                <h1>About ZARU Studios</h1>
                <p>ZARU Studios is a Helsinki-based office redefining architecture as a practice that bridges spaces and people, rather than focusing solely on new construction. We see architecture not just as the creation of buildings but as a platform for connecting communities, activating underused spaces, and fostering meaningful interactions.</p>
                <p>Our design philosophy centers on the belief that the future of architecture lies in rethinking how spaces serve the people who use them. By prioritizing adaptive reuse over demolition, and collaboration over hierarchy, we aim to create environments that are both sustainable and socially transformative. Every project is an opportunity to merge innovative design with human experience, crafting spaces that inspire, include, and are sustainable.</p>
                <p>Founded in 2024, ZARU Studios has a mission to transform overlooked places into vibrant communities of culture. Guided by this forward-thinking vision, we approach each project as a chance to reimagine what architecture can be: sustainable socially and for the environment.</p>
                <p>This Portfolio showcases our philosophy and projects—a collection of works that illustrate how architecture is problemsolving which can unite spaces and people in lasting and meaningful ways.</p>
