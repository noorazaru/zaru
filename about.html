            <h1>About ZARU Studios</h1>
            <p>ZARU Studios is a Helsinki-based office redefining architecture as a practice that connects spaces and people, a platform to activate underused spaces.</p>
            <p>Founded in 2024, ZARU Studios has a mission to transform overlooked places into communities of culture. Guided by this forward-thinking vision, we approach each project as a chance to reimagine what architecture can be: sustainable for the environment and socially.</p>
            <p>This website showcases our philosophy and projects — a collection of projects that illustrate how architecture is problem-solving which can unite spaces and people in lasting and meaningful ways.</p>
            <p>As of March 2024: Helsinki Metropolitan Area had approximately 616,000 m² of vacant office space, reflecting a vacancy rate of 14.5% (<a href="https://www.rakli.fi/en/helsinki-research-forum/" target="_blank">Rakli</a>).</p>
            <p>Before we build new buildings, we need to make use of these empty spaces. ZARU Studios' mission is to design spaces with property owners to solve this problem. </p>
            <p>Our design philosophy centers on the belief that the future of architecture lies in <strong>rethinking how spaces serve the people</strong> who use them.</p>
            <p>Has your space been vacant for a long time? Let us help you. Contact us at <a href="mailto:zarucontact@gmail.com">zarucontact@gmail.com</a>.</p>
