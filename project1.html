            <p>Student work for City of Helsinki. The plan combines Lenin's Park and Alppipuisto Park into a single green space.
The events and festivals that are part of Alppila’s identity and Linnanmäki are key sources of vitality for the area, and the new pink houses at the junction before Linnanmäki and the park underline the festive and historic spirit of the area.</p>

            <p>Sustainability and environmental responsibility guide the design: Buildings from the site will not be demolished, as demolition is not suitable from a climate point of view. The church, which is under threat of demolition, will be preserved and the space will be converted into a restaurant and museum. </p>

            <p>Cultural understanding and sense of place will be taken into account: The music studios close to Savonkatu car repair building will be moved to the church (if church is leaving).
The ability to adapt to change is the basis of the design: the new pink and red point buildings will be of beam and column construction, allowing for flexibility of space, and building heights will be 6-8 storeys.
In addition, a new park will be added to the plan.</p>
